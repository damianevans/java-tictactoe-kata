# Tic Tac Toe kata (Java)

Write an application and unit tests to handle the rules for a game of tic tac toe.

Rules:

- Player 'X' always goes first

- Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either:

    - One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
    - All nine squares are filled.

- If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins

- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
